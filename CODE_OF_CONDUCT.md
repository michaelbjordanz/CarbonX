# Code of Conduct

## 1. Our mission  
At CarbonX we’re building an inclusive, constructive open-source platform for sustainability, AI, web3, and carbon-credit innovation. We believe everyone brings value, regardless of experience level, background, or identity.  
We want discussions and contributions to be friendly, respectful, and focused on solving real problems.  

## 2. Scope  
This Code of Conduct applies to:  
- Contributors submitting issues or pull requests.  
- Participants in discussions, chat channels, forums connected with this project.  
- Members of the project team when interacting with the community.  
It covers all public spaces of the project (e.g., GitHub issues, pull requests, discussion boards, chats) and may apply to in-person or online events organized by the community.

## 3. Expected Behaviour  
Please abide by these guidelines:  
- Be welcoming: Help newcomers feel at home, answer questions respectfully, provide guidance if someone is stuck.  
- Be considerate: Recognise others may have different backgrounds or levels of experience.  
- Be collaborative: Offer constructive feedback, focus on the issue, not the person.  
- Use inclusive language: Avoid jargon or idioms excluding non-native speakers; avoid assumptions about gender, ability, culture.  
- When reviewing code or design, do so with empathy:  
  - Point out what’s good *and* what can be improved.  
  - Frame suggestions, not commands (“How about if we did …?” instead of “You must …”).  
- Own up to mistakes gracefully: If you err, apologise, fix, and move on.

## 4. Unacceptable Behaviour  
The following are not okay:  
- Harassment, intimidation or discrimination in any form (including based on race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion, age, national origin, or any other attribute).  
- Use of sexualised or insulting language, unwelcome sexual attention or comments.  
- Trolls, insulting or demeaning comments, public or private.  
- Publishing others’ private information (e.g., personal email addresses, a person’s home address) without their consent.  
- Spamming, publishing irrelevant/off-topic issues or PRs in a way that disrupts the project.  
- Derailing discussions, hijacking threads or intentionally generating extra noise to block progress.

## 5. Consequences  
If someone violates this Code of Conduct:  
- A maintainer or moderator may privately contact the person to address the behaviour, provide guidance, or request correction.  
- If the behaviour continues or is severe, the person may be temporarily or permanently banned from the repository, chat channels, issue tracker, or other project spaces.  
- Maintainers reserve the right to take any other action they deem appropriate to preserve the safety, respect, and effectiveness of the community.

## 6. Reporting a Concern  
If you witness or experience unacceptable behaviour:  
1. Contact a project maintainer (for example via email, GitHub direct message, or project chat).  
2. Provide:  
   - Description of the incident (what happened, when, where).  
   - Names or handles of those involved.  
   - If relevant, any supporting evidence (screenshots, links to discussion).  
3. The maintainers will review your report, keep it confidential, and respond in a timely manner.

If the maintainers are unavailable or you feel uncomfortable contacting them directly, you may escalate by emailing conduct@carbonx.org (monitored by a neutral third party).  

## 7. Attribution  
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, with modifications to fit the CarbonX community.
